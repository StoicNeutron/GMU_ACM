<h1>GMU ACM Algorithm Visualizer</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h5>Welcome to the GMU ACM Algorithm Visualizer! </h4>
<p>This innovative web application and PC GUI application is designed for the visual exploration of a wide range of algorithms. Developed with a focus on interactivity and user engagement, our visualizer serves as a valuable educational tool for both students and enthusiasts eager to delve into algorithmic concepts.

Leveraging the powerful and modern capabilities of Next.js, our project ensures a seamless and efficient user experience.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p><b>Interactive Visualization:</b> Step through algorithms at your own pace to understand their mechanics and intricacies.<br><b>Diverse Algorithm Set:</b> From sorting to graph algorithms, explore a vast array of computational methods.<br><b>User-friendly Interface:</b> Navigate through our intuitive layout to focus on learning rather than figuring out controls.</p>

<h3>Visuals</h3>
<h5>Home Screen:</h6>
<p><i>The home screen presents a dynamic grid where algorithms come to life. Customize your experience with adjustable speeds and step through each process for a thorough understanding.</i><p>
